EXCEPTION SCRIPT
Write a script that would require a make and a model as inputs and prints out the number of cars sold and the average of the
sale price before taxes (net) of the cars for that make and model.
To handle exceptional cases use exceptions that will be raised in two different circumstances

when no cars of the inputed make and model are sold

when only one car is sold.

If no cars are sold just display a message

If only one car is sold, print only the price (net) and not the average.
