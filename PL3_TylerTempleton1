/*
Write a stored procedure which accepts a customer name as a parameter and "returns" the number of cars the customer has bought 
and total amount of money he/she has spent. Test the above procedure by writing a script which:

prompts the user for a beginning letter
prompts the user for an ending letter
calls the procedure to show the total spent and the number of cars purchased by each customer whose name begins with a letter
between the beginning and ending letters (inclusive). For example if the beginning letter is "A" and the ending letter is "D",
the result should show all the customers whose name begins with A, B, C and D. If "A" and "Z" is entered the result should show 
all customers. Use a cursor and include appropriate exception handling.
Hint:
See REGEXP_LIKE operator on how to find the names that begin with letters included between two given values.
